# MOCK SERVER

The idea behind this mock-server is to create APIs that responds whaterver you want.

MockServer can be used for mocking any system you integrate with via HTTP (i.e. services, web sites, etc).รง
When MockServer receives a request, it matches the requested path against an active endpoint that have been configured.
An endpoint defines the action that is taken, for example, a response could be returned with an specific status code.

MockServer supports the follow actions:
